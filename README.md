This is a simple android application that will be used to demo android CI/CD process using [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) as part of [ACL session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KBKK27I8Ji3m7Xs76G-uuzRhD8JY1NfVySQSWd0KT3A/edit?usp=sharing).

`Continuous integration` is a practice of integrating source code into a shared repository frequently, then each commit is verified by an automated system to check for errors or get reports on code quality.

Examples of continuous integration processes for android projects include:

- Performing build.
- Linting - Analyzing source code to check for language syntax violation.
- Executing tests  ie. unit tests and instrumentation tests.
- Generating reports. Eg tests reports, lint reports etc.

`Continuous delivery` is a practice of getting changes(ie. new features, bug fixes, configuration changes) into production or into the users‚Äô/testers‚Äô hands safely and quickly or frequently.

Examples of continuous delivery processes for android projects include:

- Creating a [GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases).
- Deploying to [Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution).
- Deploying to Google Play Store.
- Updating automated documentation. Eg. when using automated documentation tools like [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka).

## Getting Started
Simplified overview of the project's CI/CD pipeline:

<img src="images/workflow.png"/>

## Intro

-- WIP explanation

```YAML
name: Build # name of the workflow

on:
  push: # specifies events to trigger the workflow
    branches: [ feature ] # branches that trigger the workflow

...continued
```

## Build Job

-- WIP explanation

```YAML
...continuation

jobs: # groups the jobs to be executed in this workflow

  build: # defines a job called build
    name: üî® Build # [optional] name of the job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # the job will be executed on ubuntu runner. Other include: Microsoft Windows & MacOS runners
    steps: # groups together all the steps that run in build job

      # Checks out code from the VCS to the runner
      - name: Checkout code # [optional] specifies the name of the step
        uses: actions/checkout@v2 # specifies which action and version to execute ie. checkout@v2

      # Setup JDK Version 11 in the runner
      - name: Set up JDK 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: '11'

      # Allow permissions to make gradle executable - This can removed by adding the gradlew file permission
      # directly into the repository using `git update-index --chmod=+x gradlew`
      # - name: Make gradle executable
      #  run: chmod +x ./gradlew

      # Execute gradle build command with stacktrace flag
      - name: Build with gradle
        run: ./gradlew build --stacktrace # Execute gradle script to build project

```

## Lint Job

-- WIP explanation

```YAML
lint-check: # defines another job called lint
    name: üîç Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Lint check
        run: ./gradlew lint # Execute gradle script to perform lint check

      - name: Generate lint report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2 # Uses upload-artifact@v2 action to upload lint report artifact
        with: # Define extra parameters
          name: lint_report.html # Name of the artifact to be uploaded
          path: app/build/reports/lint-results-debug.html # Specifies the path where the artifact to be uploaded is located
```

## Unit Tests Job

-- WIP explanation

```YAML
unit-tests: #Defines another job called unit tests
    name: üß™ Unit Tests

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Execute unit tests
        run: ./gradlew test --stacktrace # Execute gradle script to execute unit tests

      - name: Generate test report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
